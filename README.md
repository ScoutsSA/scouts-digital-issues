## Code Contributions
Due to the nature of Scouts Digital not being owned by ScoutsSA, but rather an independant 3rd party company

As a general rule, code contributions to SD come with a lot more red tape and safegaurds.

As such, currently code contribution requests towards Scouts Digital directly are not recommended, it's far easier to make your recommendations here, and if you'd like to make long term feature requests, head over to our new development (Ssalute) 

If you're exceptionally keen though, we won't turn you away, reach out to john.roux@scouts.org.za.
